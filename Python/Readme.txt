Python is an easy to learn and understand, powerful programming language.

Features:
_______________________________________
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
Available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly compared to C/C++/Java programming.
Simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs
Allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.
It is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.
Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
    - the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
    - statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
    - no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
Python is extensible: Any program written in C can be used in Python.
Free and open-source
Less development time
Portable- Works on Mac/Windows/Linux

Installation:

Python Interpreter Commands:
_______________________________________
Open Windows PowerShell
python --version -> Shows the version of python installed in your system 
pip --version -> Shws the version and path of PIP
python -> Opens Python Interpreter or REPL(Read-Evaluate-print loop). Shows the version of python installed in your system
exit() -> Exit from Python Interpreter or REPL
print("Hello World") -> print is a function

Terminologies:
Modules: A file containing codes written by others which can be imported and used in our program
    eg. -> import os (os is a buit-in module which comes with python installation)
    2 types of Modules:
    1) Built-in - Pre-installed in python
        eg: os, abc etc. (https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
    2) External - need to install using pip
        eg: tensorflow, flask etc.
pip: Package manager for python. helps to install a module on your system
    eg. -> pip install flask (installs flask module)  

Comments: Documentaions or notes inside program which is not executed
    Single line comment starts with #
    Multi-line comments written using ''' comment '''
